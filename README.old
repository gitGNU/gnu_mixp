Mixp

* What is Mixp

Mixp is a Guile interface to expat, James Clark's XML Parser.  

It is not complete because some features are lacking or are not
tested, because I would like to write a more high-level interface, and
because the documentation is partial.

But I think it is usable.  At least it contains everything I have ever
used in expat, plus a few ways to build higher-level structure from an
XML document.

* Expat

A version of Expat is delivered with this distribution in the expat/
subdirectory.  You may try to use an alternate version of expat by
changing a variable in the Mixp Makefile. Of course you are on your
own if Mixp does not compile with your version...

The home page of Expat is at http://expat.sourceforge.net.

* News

This section only lists the most important new features. See the
documentation to see how to use them, and ChangeLog for minor new
features and bug fixes.

** News between 20000821 and 20000826
*** Bug fix
External entity parsing.  See the documentation (section "How to...").

** News between 20000616 and 20000821

*** Minor modifications
No functional addition.

** News between 20000220 and 20000616

*** Removed usage of deprecated features
Removed usage of scm_smobfuns and scm_newsmob, which were deprecated
(thanks to Olivier Buechel).

** News between 19991221 and 20000220

*** Added conversion functions from UTF-8 to Latin1, UCS-2 and UCS-4.
These functions may be useful to handle the results of the parser,
which are in UTF-8.

*** Added mixp:xml->list and mixp:xml->tree to build flat-list of
hierarchical tree structures from an XML document.

* Installation

See INSTALL.

* Documentation

A documentation in Info and HTML format is available in doc/.  See
also the Scheme (.scm) test programs for how to use this interface.
And the expat documentation (xmlparse.h in expat/xmlparse/) for even
more information.

* Using Mixp

  This is a sample Guile script using Mixp to print the start and end
  tags of an XML document:
   
  (use-modules (xml expat)
               (xml mixp))

  ;; Create the parser object
  (let ((parser (expat:parser-create)))
    ;; Specify callback functions
    (expat:set-element-handler parser
	  		       (lambda (p name attribs)
			         (display "start ")(display name)(newline))
			       (lambda (p name)
			         (display "end ")(display name)(newline)))
    ;; Parse the file
    (mixp:parse-file parser "REC-xml-19980210.xml")
