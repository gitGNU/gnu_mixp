	[v] Adapt code to Guile 1.6 syntax.

	* test/test-mixp.scm: Changed all non-syntax unquoted () to '().
	Changed all calls to format to include the port (or #t/#f) as a
	first argument.

2003-01-15  Dmitry Morozhnikov  <dmiceman@mail.ru>

	Work around Guile 1.6.1 bug: Export (xml mixp) macros, too.

	Reported by Christian Neukirchen.

2003-01-09  Dmitry Morozhnikov  <dmiceman@mail.ru>

	Adapt to work with Guile 1.6.

	Reported by Christian Neukirchen.

2002-09-12  Dmitry Morozhnikov  <dmiceman@mail.ru>

	Also distribute INSTALL.

2002-09-12  Dmitry Morozhnikov  <dmiceman@mail.ru>

	Mention ‘--with-expat’ option to configure script in README.

2001-08-12  Seth Alves, Eric Hanchrow

	* Seth and Eric reported a compilation problem: CFLAGS included
	the standard directories before the expat directory, which could
	lead to compilation errors if another version of expat is
	installed somewhere else.

	* Other patches by Seth Alves seem to be necessary with the CVS
	version of Guile. See the INSTALL file.

2001-07-14  Thierry Bezecourt  <thbz@thbz.org>

        * No functionality modification. I only change my email address.

2000-08-30  Thierry Bezecourt  <thbz@thbz.cx>

	* mixp.texi: more documentation about handlers.

	* gexpat.c, generic_handlers.h: debugging of the external entity
	parsing.

2000-08-26  Thierry Bezecourt  <thbz@thbz.cx>

	* gexpat.c, generic_handlers.h: support for external entity
	parsing (see doc.)

	* xml/mixp.scm: added mixp:call-with-input-string and
	mixp:call-with-input-file

2000-08-01  Thierry Bezecourt  <thbz@thbz.cx>

	* doc/mixp.texi: bug fix in the documentation (Thanks to Olivier
	Buechel.)

2000-06-16  Thierry Bezecourt  <thbz@thbz.cx>

	* compilation: replaced deprecated function calls (Thanks to
	Olivier Buechel.)

2000-02-07  Thierry Bezecourt  <thbz@worldnet.fr>

	* xml/mixp.scm (mixp:tree->list, mixp:list->tree): added these
	procs.

	* gexpat.c (xml_get_error_code): fixed the return code of this
	function (which was simply wrong).

2000-01-27  Thierry Bezecourt  <thbz@worldnet.fr>

	* xml/mixp.scm (xml): added two procedures: mixp:xml->list to build a
	list of XML nodes from a port, mixp:xml->tree to build a tree
	of XML nodes from a port (the implementation is tail-recursive to
	avoid stack overflows).

	* gexpat.c, mixp.texi: removed expat:parser-free from the Scheme
	interface (the garbage collector will take care of that).

1999-12-22  Thierry Bezecourt  <thbz@worldnet.fr>

	* mixp.scm: added mixp:utf8->latin1 to convert UTF-8 strings
	(returned by the parser) to Latin-1 strings. Will fail if the
	original string is not a valid UTF-8 string, or if it contains
	non-Latin-1 characters.

	* mixp.scm: added other conversion functions: mixp:utf8->ucs2,
	mixp:utf8->ucs4
