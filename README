Look README.old, INSTALL.old for Thierry Bézecourt notes.

Unlike original mixp, this version has licensed only via GPL. Look at COPYING
for license text.

Also, unlike original mixp -- expat library not included in distro. You can
take it from http://expat.sf.net. If ./configure script cannot find location
where it is installed -- simple specify option --with-expat=/where/they/are

Also -- see INSTALL for generic installation instructions.
