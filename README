Mixp

Mixp is a Guile interface to expat, James Clark's XML Parser,
originally written by Thierry Bézecourt.  This release of Mixp is
available under the terms of the GNU GPL v3 (or later); see COPYING.
It has been tested with Guile 1.4 and 1.6.

Mixp provides two modules for use by Guile Scheme code:

  (mixp expat)  -- corresponds roughly to libexpat API
  (mixp utils)  -- high-level convenience procs

See documentation in doc/ for details.


Installation
------------
Generic install instructions are provided in the file INSTALL.
If you're in a hurry:

  ./configure [options]
  make
  make check
  make install

Normally, the configure script looks for the system-installed expat and
Guile headers/libs.  Option ‘--with-expat=DIR’ specifies another location.


Don't Panic
-----------
Please report bugs to Thien-Thi Nguyen (the current Mixp maintainer).
The email address is available in the output of "./configure --help".
