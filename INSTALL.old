No autoconf/automake (yet).

To install Mixp:

* Compilation

  Run `make' and everything should be fine.

  However, I have tested the compilation under Linux 2.2 and Solaris
  2.6 only.  If you are on another platform, or if the compilation
  fails, you may need to edit the Makefile and follow the instructions
  at the beginning.  Please let me know if you had to modify the
  Makefile.

  The compilation builds expat in the expat/ directory, a shared
  library `libexpat.so', and a main program named `guile-expat'. 
  guile-expat is not really necessary, it is only a version of the
  guile shell with Mixp included.
 
  If you have any problem, see Troubleshooting.

* Run the test programs: `make test' in the top-level directory.

  It should print "All tests are successful".  See Troubleshooting if
  it does not. 

* Add the `mixp' subdirectory to your GUILE_LOAD_PATH variable. 

  Note that only the two following files are necessary to use Mixp:

    mixp.scm
    libexpat.so

  Now you can run the test program manually (or any other Scheme script
  which uses Mixp) with:

    cd test && guile -s test-mixp.scm

* Install the documentation

  The documentation is in texinfo and Info format in doc/mixp.texi and
  doc/mixp.info.  It is also available in HTML in doc/mixp_toc.html

* Troubleshooting.

** If the compilation fails

  Please check your version of Guile.  This version has been tested
  with Guile 1.4.

  I welcome feedback about installing and using Mixp, especially on
  other platforms than Linux and Solaris.

  2001/08/09: Seth Alves reports that Mixp cannot be compiled with the
  latest CVS version of Mixp. See his patch in the file
  patch-seth-20010809. He also reports that one of the tests fails
  with that version of Mixp.

** If the test fail

  Please relaunch the test in debug mode with the following commands
  (replace the second line with `setenv GUILE_LOAD_PATH ..' if your
  shell is csh or tcsh):

    cd test
    export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=..
    guile -s test-mixp.scm -d

  Then send the output to me with any other
  relevant information (Mixp version, Guile version, operating system,
  compiler, weather information...).  Of course, a patch to fix the bug
  will be even more welcome...
